# Unity3D_Four-In-a-Row-3D
4x4x4 four in a row

a 2-player-1-keyboard game

use the arrows keys (or w-a-s-d) to pick a column
use space key to drop a piece
use ctrl and alt to move the camera around the board

the purpose of the game is to get 4 in a row (as its name implies) - it can be in a row, a column or a diagonal line

at the moment, the "IsWinning" function is very un-ellegant. hopefully it will be fixed someday...

enjoy!
